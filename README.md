Spotube is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) based lightweight spotify client. It utilizes the power of Spotify & Youtube's public API & creates a hazardless, performant & resource friendly User Experience
![Application Screenshot](assets/spotube-screenshot.png)

# Features

Following are the features that currently spotube offers:

- Open Source
- Anonymous/Guest Login
- Cross platform
- No telemetry, diagnostics or user data collection
- Lightweight & resource friendly
- Native performance (Thanks to Flutter+Skia)
- Playback control is on user's machine instead of server based
- Small size & less data hungry
- No spotify or youtube ads since it uses all public & free APIs (But it's recommended to support the creators by watching/liking/subscribing to the artists youtube channel or add as favourite track in spotify. Mostly buying spotify premium is the best way to support their valuable creations)
- Lyrics
- Downloadable track
