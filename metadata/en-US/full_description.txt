Features:
* Open source/libre software
* Anonymous/guest login
* Cross platform support
* No telemetry, diagnostics or user data collection
* Lightweight & resource-friendly
* Native performance (Thanks to Flutter+Skia)
* Playback control is done locally instead of on the server
* Small size & less data usage
* No Spotify or YouTube ads since it uses all public & free APIs (It is still recommended to support the creators by watching/liking/subscribing to the artists' YouTube channels or liking their tracks on Spotify. Purchasing Spotify Premium is usually the best way to support their valuable creations.)

* Downloadable tracks
